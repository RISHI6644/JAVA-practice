        /* Searching: Searching is the process of finding an item with specified properties
            from a collection of items. The items may be stored as simple data elements in arrays,
            nodes in trees, text in files, records in a database, vertices and edges in graphs,
            or they may be elements of other search spaces.

            Why do we need Searching?
            => Searching is one of the core computer science algorithms. We know that todayâ€™s computers
                store a lot of information. To retrieve this information proficiently we need very efficient
                searching algorithms.

/* Inheritance: Consider the following scenario:
        In real world, parents pass their properties such as money, traits, values etc. to their children. So, children
        can inherit the properties from their parents. And that is known as inheritance.

        In terms of classes, let's say if there is a class that can use the properties of another class will be called
        as base class or parent class. And the class which inherits the properties from base class will be called as
        child class.

        To inherit the base class defines to incorporate the definition of a class to another class(child). And to do
        that we can use 'extends' keyword.

        Syntax: class ChildClass extends BaseClass {}

Use cases of Java
1. Building Android Apps (Native Android apps)

4. Scientific Applications

and many more.............

How Java works ?
1. Programmer writes the source code
2. Source code is then compiled into bytecode
3. Bytecode is executed over the VM(virtual machine)
4. The program works over the machine
